# Salary Prediction of Data Scientists

As part of my MIE1624: Intro to Data Science and Analytics course, I was tasked to predict the yearly compensation of Data Scientists around the world using an open data scientist data set from Kaggle ("2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey Challenge). 

The purpose of this project was to:
- Understand and explore employment in the data science community, as represented in a survey 
- Train, validate, and tune multiple regressors that can predict, given a set of survey responses by a data scientist, what a survey respondent's current yearly compensation is. 

In addition to the Jupyter notebook submission, a small powerpoint and PDF describes my findings from exploratory analysis, model feature importance, model results and visalizations.
